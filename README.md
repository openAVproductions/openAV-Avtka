AVTKA - OpenAV
==============

AVTKA is a plain C library for building simple user interfaces.
It is developed to be easy to use, and fast to develop with.

Current Status
--------------
Avtka is developed in sync with the Ctlra library, in order to provide
user-interfaces for virtualized physical interfaces. As such, it is
not "yet another generic user-interface library". It is a purpose built
toolkit to achieve a very specific purpose - and it happens to be quite
good at that. Should you use Avtka in a project of your own? Please get in
contact before doing so - to make sure any expectations are aligned with
reality!
